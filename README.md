# D'Antae Aronne's Learning C++ Demo Game
This project is a simple game I developed to demonstrate my proficiency in C++ and game development concepts.     
While the design could expand further, my focus was to create a functional and engaging experience that highlights my understanding of object-oriented programming, game mechanics, and systems development.     
     
## Skills Demonstrated:     
- **Inheritance:** Created a dynamic enemy system, allowing for different enemy types to share common attributes while implementing unique behaviors as well as those shared with the player.     
- **Vector Manipulation:** Used vectors to handle the turn order, enemy deaths or enemies being added to the fight, and action resolution.     
- **Data Tracking:** Tracked character stats and equipment management as well as progress throughout multiple combats.     
- **Code Reusability:** Created multiple reusable methods to reduce redundancy and allow for common functions to be called upon    
     
## Game Design Features:
- Multiple enemy types with unique actions for when they reach low health     
- A cooldown system for certain actions to promote the player planning out their actions for each turn     
- A means of adding and removing characters to a battle mid combat     
- A system of rewarding the player with random equipment to promote different builds for each playthrough
